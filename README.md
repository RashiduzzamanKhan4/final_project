🎉 SmartPlanner – The App That Gets Stuff Done (Even when we don’t)
# 🧠 SmartPlanner – Because Sticky Notes Are So Last Century

Welcome to **SmartPlanner**, the productivity app built by Akib Khan(rkhan5@oakland.edu) during his epic coding quest, fueled by late-night chai and sheer willpower.  
Built with JavaFX, wrapped in OOP love, and polished like your favorite meme template.

## ⚡ What Does It Do?

It’s a planner. It plans.  
You add tasks. It remembers them.  
You click things. It shows stuff.

**Categories?** You bet.
- 🧑‍💻 Work
- 📚 Study
- 🧘 Personal (because self-care, bro)

## ✨ Features You Didn't Know You Needed

- 💾 Auto-saves tasks even if your laptop rage-quits
- 📆 Beautiful due-date picker (for pretending you'll do it tomorrow)
- 🎨 Minimalist UI that says "I’m productive" even if you're binge-watching YouTube
- 🧩 Click a task to reveal its *deep, mysterious* description (probably just “Finish project”)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (aka What I Wrestled With)

- Java 17 (a.k.a. the “Why won’t this compile?!” version)
- JavaFX 17 SDK
- OOP so clean it exfoliates
- 📁 Saved data using the ancient art of “Text File Sorcery”
